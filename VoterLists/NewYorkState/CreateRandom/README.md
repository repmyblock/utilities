# utilities
These are the utilities to process the voters files

This is a simple C program that will try to compress the whole voter file into memory live
so it can be used to generate small subset of voter files that are random as to protect privacy
but don't require the CD.

To use, download the C file and then run gcc GenerateRandom.c -o GenerateRandom (You need to have the 
state BOE File to run it.)

To request it, go to the State of New York BOE website.
